"""PR3 commit 2 — decision-trace contract module.

Defines the frozen dataclasses, rejection-code sentinels, and flag helper
that commits 3–8 will wire into the planner. This module lands ahead of
any capture logic so commit 1's tripwire tests (``tests/test_pr3_decision_trace.py``
Section A + ``tests/test_pr3_warm_start.py`` imports) can collect and
pass without any behaviour change in the planner.

Public symbols:

- ``DecisionTrace`` — one per placed section, captured by ``auto_place_board``
  from commit 3 onwards. Holds the chosen slot + up to 3 alternatives.
- ``Alternative`` — a single rejected candidate slot, tagged with a
  rejection-code sentinel so a registrar can see *why* the planner chose
  the slot it did over this one.
- ``INSTRUCTOR_CLASH`` / ``STUDENT_CONFLICT`` — the two new PR3 rejection
  sentinels, joining the PR1 (``PRAYER_WINDOW_CLASH``, ``LOCK_VIOLATION``)
  and PR2 (``NO_ROOM_*``, ``ROOM_*``) sets. ``STUDENT_CONFLICT`` is
  named *conflict* — not *overlap* — because it captures cohort
  semantics (≥1 shared student enrolled in another section at this slot),
  not geometric time-overlap. DoR sign-off amendment A.
- ``is_decision_trace_enabled()`` — reads ``TIMETABLE_PR3_DECISION_TRACE_ENABLED``.
  Default ``True`` from commit 2 onwards: capture is observational and
  safe to enable immediately. When ``False`` the planner still emits
  ``decision_trace={}`` in the payload for schema stability (DoR
  amendment: schema-stability clause).

Expected ``rejection_context`` keys by code (``Alternative.rejection_context``
is typed ``dict[str, Any]``; keys below are populated by commit 3's capture
code and left empty otherwise):

- ``INSTRUCTOR_CLASH``: ``clashing_section`` (``"<course>|<section>"``),
  ``clashing_instructor_id``.
- ``STUDENT_CONFLICT``: ``clashing_section``, ``shared_student_count``.
- ``PRAYER_WINDOW_CLASH``: ``prayer_window`` (e.g. ``"dhuhr"``).
- ``LOCK_VIOLATION``: ``locked_section``.
- ``NO_ROOM_CAPACITY`` / ``NO_ROOM_GENDER`` / ``NO_ROOM_TYPE``: no extra
  keys — the candidate slot itself carries the day/time/room tried.
- ``ROOM_OCCUPIED``: ``occupying_section``.
- ``ROOM_BUFFER_REJECT``: ``raw_demand``, ``buffered_demand``, ``capacity``.
- ``ROOM_HEURISTIC_MISMATCH``: ``heuristic``, ``is_lab_course``.

Typing is intentionally loose (``dict[str, Any]``) — pinning a TypedDict
per code would balloon PR3 scope. Stable key names are the contract; the
docstring is the ledger.
